I'm Daniel Cruz, I'm working as Frontend developer ðŸ˜Ž, I use Javascript based technologies to practice and work, because
of this, I have
strong foundations of Javascript syntax and best practices.

## About this project

This is the second version of my portfolio, the first one has made on Next.js, but I really want to make a low cost site
and deploy it in AWS cloud. This project is made from scratch, only with Vite Typescript template. React, React router
dom and so on installations and configurations are made by my own.
