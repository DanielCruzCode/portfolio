  "working-xp-page.company-creaciones-digitales": "My role was a Frontend developer junior, we had to create user interfaces using web tools like HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We used two frameworks called Tailwindcss and Vuejs for the main project. This job gives me the first approach to remote work and the basis of coo-working.",
  "working-xp-page.company-blacksip": "This was the biggest company that I have worked for. I started with a Junior Backend Developer role because I applied for that job and had the required knowledge. However, the tech lead found a more fitting role for me as a Frontend Developer.{br}{br}This role was extremely important in the company since we used a low-code platform called Vtex. While this technology was robust, it had many known bugs. Frontend developers were in charge of 90% of the configurations and real customization for each client. As a result, I learned a lot of CSS tricks, and the foundations of Javascript and SCRUM.",

During this time, I've learned all the ins and outs of React.{br}{br}To improve my abilities, I've been working on personal projects using React, pushing myself to experiment with new features. And, to take my expertise to the next level, I've been using Typescript with React to minimize errors and Ensure that my code is the best it can be. \uD83D\uDD25{br}{br}I'm always excited to try new things, and learn more about React and its new features.\n",
  "knowledge-page.javascript": "I've been in the world of web development for 4 years now and it's safe to say that JavaScript I use this language all the time.. This language is so versatile that it allows me to explore beyond just web development. I've used JavaScript to create tests with Arduino boards, build sensors with graphical representations, and even connect to my room lights with simple robots, all thanks to the amazing Jonny-Five library.\uD83E\uDD16{br}{br}To ensure that I am always up to date with the latest JavaScript practices, I make it a daily routine to read a chapter of the \"Clean Code in JavaScript\" by James Padolsey.

Nowadays, it's one of my go-to tools for creating more maintainable and reliable projects.{br}{br}Typescript has taught me some hard lessons about bad coding practices, and the benefits of using strong data types are undeniable. It has made me a much more efficient coder, and I can honestly say that it's better than I ever imagined.",

With the arrival of Deno \uD83E\uDD95, I now enjoy an even smoother development experience.",
  "knowledge-page.html": "HTML is the basis of web development. I learned with legacy concepts like table-driven design \uD83E\uDEE0. In the beginning, that was boring, but with new knowledge about the web and particular tags, I started to understand the importance of this language in topics like SEO, design patterns, and tricks. Every time I can, I read the browser tag compatibility to add some new tags or attributes. One of my favorites that I have had the pleasure to use was the details element to create an accessible and native pop-up/modal.",
  "knowledge-page.figma": "I learned this design tool on my own. I want to create my own design systems and make my own interfaces.

My future is lead a team, and the positive and constructive feedback is one of my best tools to throw me to that place.",

I use two types of boards in Jira: Kanban (best for ensuring task fulfillment) and Scrum-based boards (the most commonly used). I feel really comfortable with this tool and the mindset behind it.
